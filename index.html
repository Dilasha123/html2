    <p class="id"> Some of the varieties of Daisies are the white Daisy-like flowers, the Spanish Daisy, Blue Daisy, Lazy Daisy or Prairie Daisy, African Daisy, Michaelmas Daisy, Swan River Daisy, Tatarian Daisy, Painted Daisy, Paris Daisy, Shasta Daisy, Crown-Daisy, Ox-eye Daisy, Nippon Oxeye Daisy, Giant Daisy, African Daisy, Kingfisher Daisy, Sunshine Daisy, Gerbera Daisy, Transvaal Daisy or Barberton Daisy, Tahoka Daisy, Livingstone Daisy, Gloriosa Daisy, Dahlberg Daisy and Butter Daisy. When we hear the word “daisies,” the first thing that comes to mind are the small white flowers with bright yellow centers that we used to pluck in middle school while chanting, “He loves me, he loves me not.” While the common daisy has multiplied so rapidly in the U.S. that it’s now considered to be an invasive weed, the truth is that daisies come in thousands of different varieties beyond the classic white blooms that we know and love. Some of the most popular varieties today include full-faced gerbera daisies, brightly colored African daisies, and pom pom-like chrysanthemum daisies. </p> <br>
